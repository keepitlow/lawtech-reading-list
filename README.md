# lawtech-reading-list


## About This Project / Pontification Space 
I spend an inordinate amount of time poking about online, and decided that I should organise the things I've been reading (or intend to read) a little better. The world is moving terribly fast, and I wake up every day a little more ignorant than I was the day before. This is my attempt to get a bit more organised, and also learn more about an area that I (as an inveterate humanities student) have never been truly comfortable in. 

The stuff I'm reading can be sorted into four main categories: Tech of Law (how tech can be applied to law); Law of Tech (how law can regulate tech) , Legal Education, and Access to Justice (the last 2 categories will overlap a fair bit). 

Hopefully, this list will become a good source for people who are interested in learning more about law and tech, but don't really know where to start.
