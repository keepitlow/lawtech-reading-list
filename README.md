## About This Project / Pontification Space 
I spend an inordinate amount of time poking about online, and decided that I should organise the things I've been reading (or intend to read) a little better. The world is moving terribly fast, and I wake up every day a little more ignorant than I was the day before. This is my attempt to get a bit more organised, and also learn more, given that I used to be (still sort of am) an inveterate humanities student who can't even do mental arithmetic very well. 

The stuff I'm reading can be sorted into four main categories: Tech of Law (how tech can be applied to law); Law of Tech (how law can regulate tech) , Legal Education, and Access to Justice (the last 2 categories will overlap a fair bit). 

I'm interested in how law schools around the world are incorporating technology in their curriculum (vested interest here -- I'm a law student), and how technology can be harnessed to improve access to justice. The legal industry is generally slow to respond (and exploit) technological advancement -- and its applications to access to justice seem to be slower. In Singapore where I'm from, there are plenty of projects about contract clause review using supervised machine learning, but there doesn't seem to be as many projects working on access to justice. 

Doing pro bono is gratifying, but immensely frustrating when I realise that my impact is mostly on a 1:1 scale. There is only so much of any person to go around. What are the kinds of assistance that can be scaled?
